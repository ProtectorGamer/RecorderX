# RecorderX - v1.1
A screen recorder made in Python with the help of OpenCv, it has ability to record your screen in high quality.
No matter what your PC specs are, you can use this recorder to get high quality output along with no lags (neither in output nor in pc)

`NOTE: code idea taken from Programming Hero , code being developed by Priyanshu`
## Limitations
1. Can't record your system voice currently.
2. ~~Doesn't support games recording currently. (for some computers)~~ Added Support in `v1.2`
3. That's it, nothing else :D

## How to operate?
1. On running RecorderX, powershell/cmd will be opened and you'll be asked to enter output file name along with format(it will take a few sec for the first time.), few filename examples below:
```
output.mp4
output.mkv
```
2. Now, you'll be asked if you want to use custom keys to stop recording or not;
3. If you want to change, enter `y` in console to do it, else `n` to keep the default key `q`;
4. After this it will start recording your screen (whatever you do on your screen will be recorded), and a preview window will be there for you as well;
5. To STOP recording, open preview window and press `Q` or your `custom key`..

## Where do output file saves?
Your output video file will be saved in the same folder where you executed RecorderX.
